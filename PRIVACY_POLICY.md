# Privacy Policy

At NoNSFW, your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how NoNSFW handles your data:

1. **Data Collected**  
NoNSFW processes images, attachments, and avatars uploaded to your Discord server solely to detect NSFW content. No other message content or personal data is analyzed.

2. **Caching and Hashing**  
To improve performance, NoNSFW temporarily caches unique hashes of images it processes. This helps avoid reprocessing identical images but does not store any personal user information.

3. **Data Storage**  
NoNSFW does not store, share, or sell any personal data. All processing happens securely and in compliance with privacy best practices.

4. **Third-Party Services**  
NoNSFW may use third-party AI libraries for NSFW detection but does not transmit user data outside Discord except for image analysis within the bot.

5. **Your Control**  
Server administrators can configure NoNSFWâ€™s moderation actions or disable features as needed to suit their privacy preferences.

6. **Changes to Privacy Policy**  
This policy may be updated periodically. Continued use of NoNSFW constitutes acceptance of any changes.
